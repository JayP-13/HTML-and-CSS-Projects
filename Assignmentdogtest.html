	<p>Newfoundland Landseers are a great dog as Petguide talks about them</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/landseer-newfoundland/">
	The Landseer Newfoundland is the definition of a “gentle giant”. These dogs are sweet and affectionate with family – in fact, they crave human attention and may develop problem behaviors if left alone too long during the day. This breed tends to be patient with children, which makes them a great family pet and they have guarding instincts which makes them a good watch dog. Landseer Newfoundlands tend to get along well with other household pets because they do not have a high prey drive. The only thing you need to be wary about with this breed is his size – he may accidentally knock small children over. You should also be aware that this breed has a tendency to drool a lot.
